/**
 * TAG FOR LEARNING ABOUT IMPORTS & DEPENDENCIES
 * Below this block of comments are the imports for this file.
 *
 * Imports are we how tell the compiler that we want to use some
 * code in this file that is from a different folder in our app (but
 * still code we wrote in this project) or that we are borrowing from
 * a library. The text provided after the "import" keyword is the path
 * that tells the compiler what packages to look in to find the code
 * we want.
 *
 * If importing code from a different folder in our project, of course that
 * code lives in our project so we can just give it a path to that folder
 * based on where it lives in the project.
 *
 * If we are importing code borrowed from a library outside of our project,
 * how do we find the path? Libraries are available on the internet to
 * download & our app needs to have that library downloaded and stored in our
 * application to use. It is stored as a package in our app and we can use the
 * name of that package to tell the compiler where the code is.
 *
 * How do we download libraries so we can use them? We call libraries that
 * we need for our app "dependencies" because our app is "dependent" on them
 * to work if we are using code from them. For Android we use a tool called
 * "gradle" to be a "dependency manager" for our app. This means we just tell
 * gradle what libraries we depend on and gradle will handle downloading any
 * libraries we need and making sure the packages are stored in the right places.
 *
 * For more on gradle, search for (without typing the underscores!):
 * TAG_FOR_LEARNING_ABOUT_GRADLE
 *
 * Look at the imports below for examples of what imports from other libraries
 * and from within this project look like.
